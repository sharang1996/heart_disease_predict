# heart_disease_predict
An analysis of the features and algorithms we can use to predict heart diseases

We use 5 different algorithms, and GridSearchCV to find the best hyper parameters in order to otain the highest accuracy. Our analysis phase involves finding the corelation of all features with the output, and we concluded dropping 2 loosely corelated features resulted in a better overall performance
